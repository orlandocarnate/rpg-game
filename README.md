### Option Two: Harry Potter RPG Game (Challenge)

My son loves the world of Harry Potter so I decided to do a game based on that instead of Star Wars.

Here's how the JavaScript application works:

   * When the game starts, the player will choose a character by clicking on the character's **card**, which will be used for the rest of the game.
   * The player must then defeat all of the remaining characters.
   * The player chooses the first opponent by clicking on an enemy's card.
   * The selected opponent will be moved to the fighting 'arena'.
   * The **attack button** will become active.
   * When the player clicks **attack**, their character will damage the opponent and they will lose **HP**, shown at the bottom of the opponent card.
     * The opponent will counter the attack. When that happens, the player's character will lose some of their **HP**,shown at the bottom of the player character's card.

3. The player will keep hitting the attack button in an effort to defeat their opponent.

   * When the defender's `HP` is reduced to zero or below, remove the enemy from the `defender area`. The player character can now choose a new opponent.

4. The player wins the game by defeating all enemy characters. The player loses the game the game if their character's `HP` falls to zero or below.


##### Option 2 Game design notes

* Each character in the game has 3 attributes: `Health Points`, `Attack Power` and `Counter Attack Power`.

* Each time the player attacks, their character's Attack Power increases by its base Attack Power. 
  * For example, if the base Attack Power is 6, each attack will increase the Attack Power by 6 (12, 18, 24, 30 and so on).
* The enemy character only has `Counter Attack Power`. 

  * Unlike the player's `Attack Points`, `Counter Attack Power` never changes.

* The `Health Points`, `Attack Power` and `Counter Attack Power` of each character must differ.

* No characters in the game can heal or recover Health Points. 

  * A winning player must pick their characters wisely by first fighting an enemy with low `Counter Attack Power`. This will allow them to grind `Attack Power` and to take on enemies before they lose all of their `Health Points`. Healing options would mess with this dynamic.

* Your players should be able to win and lose the game no matter what character they choose. The challenge should come from picking the right enemies, not choosing the strongest player.

## NOTES
For loop works with objects in an array **DO NOT WORK IN jQUERY** 

This doesn't work:
```
//For loop looks through each object and displays the values
    for(var i = 0; i < characters; i++) {
            console.log(characters[i].name);
            console.log(characters[i].healthPoints);
            console.log(characters[i].attackPower);
            console.log(characters[i].counterAttackPower);
    }
```

Use the `.each()`
```
// Outer key, value pairs
$.each(characters, function(i, currentChar) {
  // Inner Key, Value pairs
        $.each(currentChar, function (key, val){

            console.log(key, val)
        });

});
```

To move an element try 
`jQuery("#NodesToMove").detach().appendTo('#DestinationContainerNode')`

to get index of an element within another element try:

Pseudocode for moving cards to opponent section:
If card was selected, move it to the Player section
otherwise move it to the opponent section.
